# Japanglish: Trip to Tokyo

Japanglish is a fun educative game that began as a final project of two beginners who just started learning how to programme as a part of Czechitas' Digital Academy course. Because we both love Japanese culture and videogames, we decided to make a visual novel.

As any other visual novel, our game mainly focuses on a story and dialogues. As the story progresses, a player gets tested on a variety of Japanglish words that naturally appear in a conversation. The happiness metre shows how successful you are at guessing their meanings. Should the heart drop to zero, it's a game over and you have to start again. The game has several locations, each consisting of a unique set of test vocabulary connected to a certain place such as a train station, home, shopping centre and school.

The game is build on what we learned in the Digital Academy: HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React.
